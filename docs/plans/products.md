# Product Management Plan

## Goals
- CRUD interface for products and variants.
- Manage supplier assignments and stock levels.
- Upload/manage product media and rich content.

## Features
- Product list view with filters (category, active status, low stock).
- Product detail editor (core fields, images, care instructions).
- Variant manager: add/edit size/color, stock counts, price overrides.
- Supplier selector with link to supplier records.
- Metrics panel: views, purchases, carts (read-only for now).

## Future Considerations
- Bulk import/export (CSV).
- Draft/publish workflow.
- Media library integration.
